# Creating Webassembly modules in Python

* [py2wasm](https://wasmer.io/posts/py2wasm-a-python-to-wasm-compiler)


https://www.assemblyscript.org/

## Getting started

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

I had problems getting py2wasm to run on my machine.  Also I want very lean webassembly modules
which I am concerned I won't get.

Putting this on hold for now.
